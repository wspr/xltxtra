________________________
THE XLTXTRA PACKAGE v0.6

This package was previously used to provide a number of small
features that are useful for XeLaTeX. As of fontspec v2, many
of these have now been incorporated into that package. More
recently, other updates to LaTeX2e itself have eliminated some
of the workarounds previously included in this package.

This package therefore no longer does as much as it used to,
but is still provided for backwards compatibility. A summary:

- Loads fontspec.

- Loads Andrew Moschou's metalogo package for customised
  \XeTeX and \XeLaTeX logos.

- Loads the realscripts package to obtain OpenType-feature
  subscript and superscript glyphs in \textsuperscript etc.,
  including in footnotes.

- \showhyphens is redefined so it now works.

- Defines the dubiously useful commands
     \vfrac - for vulgar fractions using OpenType features
     \namedglyph - to access font glyphs by name

For more information see the documentation xltxtra.pdf.
